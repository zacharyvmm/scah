# HTML entity table generation

`entities.json` is a committed copy of the WHATWG named character
reference dataset.

The fixture and generator scripts under this directory are intentionally
excluded from the published `scah` crate. Runtime code uses only the
generated Rust table in `src/html/entities_table.rs`.

The raw fixture is redistributed under the licensing terms recorded in:

- `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/WHATWG-HTML.txt`
- `crates/scah/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/WHATWG-HTML.txt`

The package-local copy is included in published `scah` crates.

## Regenerate from the committed fixture

```bash
python crates/scah/scripts/generate_entities.py
```

This command is offline and deterministic. It never contacts the network
and never inserts a wall-clock timestamp into generated output.

## Update from WHATWG

```bash
python crates/scah/scripts/generate_entities.py --update-fixture
```

This downloads the upstream dataset and updates both the committed
fixture and generated Rust table from the same downloaded bytes.

The command validates and prepares both outputs before replacing either file.
Each individual file replacement is atomic, but the two replacements do not
form a filesystem transaction. If the second replacement fails, rerun the
command to restore consistency.

After updating:

```bash
python crates/scah/scripts/generate_entities.py
git diff --check
cargo test -p scah
```

## How to update the fixture

1. Run `--update-fixture` (see above).
2. Confirm the printed SHA-256 and entry count.
3. Regenerate once more without network access and confirm a clean diff.
4. Update the SHA-256 recorded in this README and in the third-party
   license notice if the upstream bytes changed.
5. Commit the fixture, generated table, and notice updates together.
